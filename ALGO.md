# Handwritten Signature Recognition Algorithm

## 1. Input and Setup
- **Input**: A scanned or digital image of the signature.
- **Output**: Whether the signature is valid (matched) or invalid (not matched).

---

## 2. Preprocessing

### 2.1 Image Loading
Load the input image and convert it to grayscale.
```python
import cv2

image = cv2.imread("signature.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
```

### 2.2 Noise Removal
Apply Gaussian Blur to remove noise.
```python
processed_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)
```

### 2.3 Thresholding
Convert the image into binary using adaptive thresholding.
```python
binary_image = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(processed_image, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C,
                                      cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
```

### 2.4 Edge Detection
Use Canny edge detection to extract the signature's edges.
```python
edges = cv2.Canny(binary_image, 50, 150)
```

---

## 3. Feature Extraction

### 3.1 Contour Extraction
Extract contours to identify the signature's shape and boundaries.
```python
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```

### 3.2 Keypoint Detection
Use SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to detect key points.
```python
sift = cv2.SIFT_create()
keypoints, descriptors = sift.detectAndCompute(binary_image, None)
```

### 3.3 Feature Representation
Represent the signature with descriptors obtained from keypoints (e.g., location, orientation, scale).

---

## 4. Signature Matching

### 4.1 Database Creation
Store pre-extracted features of valid signatures in a database for comparison.

### 4.2 Feature Comparison
Match features of the input signature with those in the database using similarity metrics like Euclidean distance.
```python
bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_L2, crossCheck=True)
matches = bf.match(descriptors_input, descriptors_database)
matches = sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x.distance)
```

### 4.3 Thresholding
Set a threshold for similarity score to determine if the signatures match.

---

## 5. Validation

### 5.1 Match Percentage
Calculate the percentage of matched keypoints relative to the total keypoints.
- If match percentage > threshold (e.g., 70%), signature is valid.

### 5.2 Decision
- If valid: Output "Signature is valid."
- If invalid: Output "Signature is invalid."

---

## 6. Post-Processing

### 6.1 Visualization
Display the matched features for debugging or transparency.
```python
matched_image = cv2.drawMatches(image1, kp1, image2, kp2, matches[:10], None, flags=cv2.DrawMatchesFlags_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS)
cv2.imshow("Matches", matched_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

### 6.2 Feedback Loop
Refine the feature extraction or matching process if recognition fails for valid signatures.

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Neural Networks
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. Train the CNN on a labeled dataset of signatures.

### 2. Data Augmentation
Augment signature images with rotations, scaling, and distortions to improve robustness.

### 3. Forgery Detection
Analyze pressure points, speed, and stroke order (if available) to detect forgery.

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct matches.
- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**: Rate of invalid signatures incorrectly recognized as valid.
- **False Rejection Rate (FRR)**: Rate of valid signatures incorrectly rejected.
